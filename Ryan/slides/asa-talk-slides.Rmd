# 1 of many thesis problems

Goal: estimate the value added or subtrated from a few dozen environmental land constraints

Method: let's use the hedonic price method and estimate the effect of each constraint with OLS! Not so fast...

![Spatial lag](figs/spatial-lag.png "Spatial lag")



# What is spatial autocorrelation?
- The degree to which two observations at a spatial location are similar to one another




# What breaks?

- *Lag:* how do neighboring property values affect me
  - Biased coefficient estimates from OLS
  
- *Correlated errors:* model over/under predicts in spatial clusters
  - OLS p-values can't be trusted! :-(


# Potential remedies

- Spatial dummies for local neighborhoods
  - Ex: census tracts, neighborhood associations, zip codes, school districts
  - Can mitigate omitted-variable bias
  - Tradeoff shrinking nbhd size reduces bias but reduces identifying variation in amenity (increasing variance)
  
- Model the correlation explicitly using spatial error or lag models




# Option 1

![Residual map with spatial dummies](figs/resid-fe.png "Residual map - FE")

- This looks better, but is there still evidence of correlation?

# Use Moran I
