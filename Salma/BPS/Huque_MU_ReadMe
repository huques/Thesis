Hello! 
  
  This is a little README for my file "Huque_MU_script.R". 

Before running the script, please ensure that you have the file "thesis-data.csv" in the correct place. This script runs it using the `here` package and assumes that it is in a folder entitled `DATA`. 

After running the script, there will be NINE data frames in the environment and ONE .htm file. The file is called `MU_final.htm` and provides the results of the model in a format common in publications. It can be opened on a browser or as a word document. 

Below is a summary of the nine dataframes the script outputs. 

1. thesis_data

Class: dataframe
Rows: 34,628
Observations: 193
About: Cleaned thesis data of all property types.


2. SFR_raw

Class: dataframe
Rows: 25,266
Observations: 193
About: A subset from `thesis_data` that only contains SFR observations. 


3. SFR_constraints_raw

Class: dataframe
Rows: 25,266
Observations: 26
About: A subset from `SFR_raw` that only contains the contraints variables. 


4. SFR_dat

Class: dataframe
Rows: 22,959
Observations: 76
About: Final cleaned dataframe that is used to run model specification on. 


5. SFR_controls_dat

Class: dataframe
Rows: 22,959
Observations: 33
About: A subset from`SFR_dat`that only contains the control variables. Used to create summary statistics. 


7. SFR_controls_table

Class: dataframe
Rows: 32
Observations: 7
About: Summary statistics for the controls from `SFR_controls_dat`. Gives the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and number of missing observations for each variable. For each summary statistic missing observations have been omitted. 


6. SFR_constraints_table

Class: dataframe
Rows: 26
Observations: 4
About: Counts for each of the constraints from `SFR_dat`. 


8. SFR_final.mod

Class: lm
About: An lm object containing the results of the final model. For standard errors and p-values, run the following command: summary(SFR_final.mod)


9. SFR_final.coef

Class: dataframe
Rows: 45
Observations: 3
About: Dataframe wit coefficients pulled from `SFR_final.mod`. The third column is the most important; the raw coefficient in second column cannot be used to make claims pertaining to sale price. When using the interpreted coefficient, you can say something like this: "Having a property located in a preservation zone decreases the sale price of the house by 3.8%".
