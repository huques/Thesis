This thesis uses hedonic pricing to estimate the effect that constraints to development have on sale prices of properties in Portland, Oregon. Using data provided by the City of Portland, Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, I created and compared models for the single family residential housing market as well as the commercial/mixed-use property market. I found that while predicted signs aligned with the results, the resulting coefficient sizes were much smaller than expected.
